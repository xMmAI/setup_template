# Brainstorming Ideas Into Designs

## When to use this skill
- When starting a new feature or project with vague requirements.
- When you need to explore potential technical approaches.
- Before writing a detailed implementation plan.

## Workflow
- [ ] **Understanding the idea:**
    - Check current project context (files, docs).
    - Ask questions **one at a time** to refine the idea.
    - Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.
- [ ] **Exploring approaches:**
    - Propose 2-3 different technical approaches.
    - Highlight trade-offs and provide a recommendation.
- [ ] **Presenting the design:**
    - Present the design in small sections (200-300 words).
    - Ask for feedback after each section.
    - Cover architecture, components, data flow, and testing.
- [ ] **Documentation:**
    - Save the validated design to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.

## Instructions

### Key Principles
- **One question at a time**: Never overwhelm the user with multiple queries.
- **Multiple choice preferred**: Suggest options to make it easier for the user to decide.
- **Ruthless YAGNI**: Focus only on what's necessary for the current goal.
- **Incremental validation**: Get sign-off on design pieces before moving forward.

### Interaction Pattern
Ensure you are in a collaborative dialogue. If a topic is complex, break it down:
"I have a few ideas for the API structure. Would you prefer a RESTful approach or GraphQL? Here are the trade-offs: ..."
